Enet is currently intended to be used as a static library since it doesn't
export any functions.
While using a DLL would be desirable (because it avoids the below problems),
we don't want to maintain a forked version of the library.
It's unclear whether the maintainers would want to integrate the macro
crap required for DLLs, so we try to cope with static libraries.

Doing so leads to "cannot find VC80.pdb" warnings. We need this symbol
information in both debug and release modes for developer use and to
allow inspecting users' crashdumps.

The VC librarian is fairly stupid and apparently can't create PDB files
with project-specific names. We therefore need some sort of directory
structure. That doesn't fit in premake's extern_libs scheme, so we have
to use the add_func escape mechanism.

note that the debug library has a _dbg suffix for maximum clarity
(this isn't strictly necessary since it's in the debug/ subdirectory)
