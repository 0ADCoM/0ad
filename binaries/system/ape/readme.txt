Instructions
=====================================================

Alter the various values either manually or using the
error buttons to change the effect.

! Some values have upper and lower limits. Furthermore,
some values are limited by relationships - e.g. you
cannot reduce the maximum lifetime below the minimum
lifetime.

To change the current active sprite, type in the name
of the bitmap file to load. Please note that you do
not need to write the absolute path of the bitmap,
but the name of the file within the /sprite directory.

! Currently APE only supports .bmp files.

If you encounter an error, e.g. a sprite not loading,
open the debugging console (the 3rd window) to look
for appropriate error messages. 

Currently there is no SAVING ... if you wish to record
an effect, write down the values in a .txt file for now.
